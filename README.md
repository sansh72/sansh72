# Sansh’s Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m Sansh, an undergraduate student with a passion for **Machine Learning**, **Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Science**, and **Web Development**. I am currently pursuing my degree in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** at **NIT Srinagar**, with an eagerness to apply my skills in **AI/ML** to real-world problems.

## About Me

- **Current Focus**: I am currently deepening my knowledge in **AI and ML**, particularly through courses like **CS229** and hands-on projects.
- **Skills**: Python, Flask, Django, React, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Data Science, Web Development, Cloud Computing.
- **Experience**: I have completed **3 ML internships**, worked on various **AI/ML projects**, and have even **submitted research papers** to conferences like **ICLR**.

I believe that **Machine Learning** and **AI** have the power to revolutionize industries, and I am passionate about using these technologies to build innovative solutions.

## Projects

Here’s a list of my notable projects on GitHub:

### 1. **Resume Parsing System**
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, SpaCy, Machine Learning
   - I developed a script for automatically extracting key information (name, email, skills, etc.) from resumes in PDF format. This project demonstrates my skills in natural language processing and machine learning for document analysis.
   
### 2. **Attendance System with Face Recognition**
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, Tkinter, Facial Recognition
   - I built an attendance system that uses face recognition to mark student attendance. The system integrates a GUI with image processing to identify students based on their facial features.

### 3. **Web Application for AI/ML Research**
   - **Technologies Used**: React, Flask, Python, OpenCV
   - A web-based research application that dynamically adjusts layouts based on user interaction and integrates **supervised and unsupervised learning** to optimize the user experience.

### 4. **2D Data Labeling Tool**
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
   - I created a tool that allows users to upload CSV files, perform clustering (KMeans/DBSCAN), and visualize data in 2D. Users can manually edit labels and export the data as CSV for further use.

### 5. **AI/ML Research Paper (ICLR Submission)**
   - **Summary**: My paper, which explores the integration of user interaction data with LLMs (like GPT-4), aims to dynamically adjust web application layouts using AI models. This paper has been submitted to **ICLR**.

## Education

- **Current Degree**: Undergraduate in **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)** at **NIT Srinagar**.
- **Courses**: I have taken courses like **Data Structures**, **Algorithms**, **OOP**, **DBMS**, and **System Design** as part of my curriculum. I am also currently enrolled in **CS229** to master **AI and ML**.
